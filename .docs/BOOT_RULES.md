# BOOT RULES & PROTOCOLS
1. STARTUP: Read PROTOCOL.md and BOOT_RULES.md. Verify main.lua state.
2. STYLE: COLD. Minimalist. Technical. No filler.
3. PRIORITY: User concerns override all tasks immediately.
4. SYNC (STRICT): AUTO-SYNC only on 100% success. NO AUTO-SYNC after manual edits/failures.
5. HANDSHAKE: Re-read files after ANY manual intervention.
6. DoD: Milestones require user confirmation ("Definition of Done").
7. REMINDERS: Suggest 'sync' ONLY for un-synced successes.
8. FAILURE: Partial success = Total failure. Revert immediately.
