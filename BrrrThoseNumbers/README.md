# Brrr Those Numbers

A Balatro mod that warns you when you're about to play your last hand, helping you avoid costly mistakes!

## Description

In the fast-paced world of Balatro, it's easy to get caught up in the excitement and accidentally play your final hand on economy boosts instead of maximizing your score. **Brrr Those Numbers** is here to save the day!

This mod displays a visual warning on the 'Play Hand' button whenever you have only one hand left, serving as a subtle but effective reminder to think twice before your next play. Stay focused on scoring big and avoid those "brrr" moments of regret.

### Features
- **Subtle Warning System**: Automatically detects when you have 1 hand remaining and displays a warning on the 'Play Hand' button.
- **Customizable**: Toggle the warning on or off via the in-game mod settings menu.
- **Non-Blocking**: Doesn't interrupt your gameplay, just provides a visual cue.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with Steamodded framework, no conflicts with other mods.
